# React Ecommerce Long Ride

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
For building the app was used:
- Firebase(a NoSQL and real-time hosting of databases)
- Context (Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.)
- React Router (It enables the navigation among views of various components in a React Application)
